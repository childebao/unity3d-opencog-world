Hurray for READMES!

To run a quick test of the UnityWorld:

1) Install Unity 4.0.0b8 (beta 8) if you haven't already.  As soon as the official 4.0 release comes out, we'll get off beta releases and switch to official releases only.
2) Run Unity and select to open the highest level folder for the project ("unity3d-opencog-world" in my case).  This is the folder that contains folders like Assets & Library, and also this README file.
3) Once the project is open, make sure to open the MainGameScene.  You'll find it under Assets/Scenes/ in the project directory.  If you see nothing but pink here, you've got a problem and should ask Lake directly.
4) Once the scene is open, press the pause button at the top of the Unity Editor.  Then press the play button.  It will take a few minutes for the level loading / generation to work.  Wait until you see the message: "Hurray! Level loaded!"
5) Once you see that message, unpause the game and then wait a bit more.  A "Generating World" splash should come across the screen.  Once that's gone, feel free to start by pressing 'W,' 'E,' or 'R.'
6) Once you've selected a character, move around with the arrow keys.

That's all for now.  Much more work to do!
